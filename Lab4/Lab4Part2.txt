From Lab3: Recursion 

View: CirclePanel (because it creates a place to display what's going on with the model, on a GUI)
Model: DrawableTarget, DrawableBubble, DrawableSmile, DrawableCircle (the last is the super class while the first ones are the subclasses that hold data for drawing)
Controller: CircleDisplay (because it makes changes to the model and the view, based on user input - has mouse listeners)
Application: CircleApplication (because it has the main method that runs the program)
